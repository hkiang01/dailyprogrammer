Welcome to cipher day!

write a program that can encrypt texts with an alphabetical caesar cipher. This cipher can ignore numbers, symbols, and whitespace.

for extra credit, add a "decrypt" function to your program!

## Demo


```zsh
$ go run .
string to encrypt
hello
rovvy
string to decrypt
rovvy
hello
```
